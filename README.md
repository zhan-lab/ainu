This program enables material parameter extraction from the analysis of experiments/characterizations. In this program, different experiments can be analyzed and the users can select their favourite theoretical model for experiment analysis. 

This program is **free for academic purposes only**. However, a valid license for MATLAB is required. For the full-physics model, a COMSOL (≥ v5.5) license is also required.

The source code of the program will be released soon. Early access to the source code for collaboration is possible by reaching out to us!

## Change log

* Version v1.0 features:
  1. Added the Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis module of a semiconductor (1D material model). <br>
  2. Three theoretical models are available to choose for TRPL analysis:
     * the kinetic (or ABC) model;
     * the full-physics model (requires a COMSOL license), which describes the drift-diffusion of carriers and the dynamic occupation of defects. <br>
  4. Added tools for TRPL experimental data preparation, which includes the removal of the noise and interpolation for analysis, and AiNU result visualization.
